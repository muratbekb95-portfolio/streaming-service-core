This project is an addition to my collection of portfolios,
which is considered to be some sort of a copy of Netflix and
used only for the purpose of improving my portfolio.
The project is about the system of list of movies available for 
premium subscribers. Publisher posts movies for watching and clients search 
for the movie to buy it, everything is simple. The project is separated into
several microservices where every microservice has its own role to play.
